    <h3 id="headline">Here is a timeline of Madam Marie-Curie's life:</h3>
<ul>
	 <li class="font18"><strong>1867</strong> - Born November 7, 1867 in Warsaw, Russian Empire (now Poland); named Maria Sklodowska. She later changed her first name to 'Marie' when she moved to Paris, France.</li>
	
	<li class="font18"><strong>1891</strong> - Marie left Poland for France.</li>
	
	<li class="font18"><strong>1895</strong> - Marie married Pierre.</li>
	
	<li class="font18"><strong>1897</strong> - Their daughter Irene was born.</li>
	
	<li class="font18"><strong>1898</strong> - In July 1898, Marie and Pierre published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element which they named "polonium", in honor of her native Poland. Later that same year, the Curies announced the existence of a second element, which they named "radium", from the Latin word for "ray". In the course of their research, they also coined the word "radioactivity". Radioactivity, is the process by which the nucleus of an unstable atom loses energy by emitting radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays and conversion electrons. A material that spontaneously emits such radiation is considered radioactive.</li>
	
	<li class="font18"><strong>1900</strong> - Curie became the first woman faculty member at the École Normale Supérieure.</li>
	
	<li class="font18"><strong>1903</strong> - In December 1903, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/pierre-curie-facts.html">Pierre Curie</a>, Marie Curie, and <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/becquerel-facts.html">Henri Becquerel</a> the Nobel Prize in Physics, <i>"in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel."</i> Their achievements included the development of the theory of radioactivity (stemming from Becquerel's research), establishing techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two highly radioactive elements: polonium (Po) and radium (Ra).</li>
	
	<li class="font18"><strong>1904</strong> - Their second child, daughter Eve, was born.</li>
	
	<li class="font18"><strong>1906</strong> - Marie was widowed after Pierre was killed in an accident while crossing a street in Paris on April 19, 1906. Pierre was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle and fell under its wheels.</li>
	
	<li class="font18"><strong>1910</strong> - After Marie and Pierre Curie first discovered the radioactive elements polonium and radium, Marie continued to investigate their properties. Curie succeeded in isolating radium and produced radium as a pure metal, which proved the new element's existence. Radium is the heaviest known alkaline earth metal. It is the only radioactive member of its group. All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive. Notably, the most stable isotope being radium-226 has a half-life of 1600 years and decays into radon gas. Radioactive compounds became important as sources of radiation in both scientific experiments and in the field of medicine, where they were/are used to treat tumors.</li>
	
	<li class="font18"><strong>1911</strong> - Marie Curie received Nobel recogniztion in Chemistry for her aforementioned work in 1910.<li>
	
	<li class="font18"><strong>1934</strong> - Marie Curie died, July 4, 1934, in Sallanches, France. She died of aplastic anaemia, a blood disease that often results from exposure to high amounts of radiation.</li>

</ul>
